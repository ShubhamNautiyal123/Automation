# Automation Tools


Automated tools for Unity, simplifying scene creation and project organization. These tools expedite the creation of scenes with predefined configurations (empty, 2D, 2D UI, 3D) and establish a structured folder layout for projects. They differentiate between 2D and 3D project types, ensuring efficient asset management and script organization. Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+N (Scene Creator), Ctrl+Alt+S (Folder Structure Builder).
